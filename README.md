This is a non-official Node.JS SDK for Microsoft Cognitive Services for Face API

This is a really simple and straightforward SDK, for now it has the basic functionalities of the FACE API:
- Create a Person
- Create a Group
- Add faces to a person
- List Created Groups
- Verifies a face to a Person
(Basically this allows you to use the Face API to do a simple facial recognition)

A demo script is included in `/test/test.js`

More features will be added with time.
Feel free to extend the code, submit error fixes / code improvements.
